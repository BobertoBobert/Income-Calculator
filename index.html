			<h2>What are tax brackets?</h2>
			<p>Tax brackets are the income range which determines the rate at which you will be taxed.
				The more you earn, the higher taxes you pay. However there is a common misconception that
				if you have a promotion that will move you up a tax bracket, this increased amount of tax
				you pay will undermine the amount you would gain from the new income. On this website we
				aim to show people that this is a myth and prove to them that they will earn more, even if
				they move up a tax bracket.
